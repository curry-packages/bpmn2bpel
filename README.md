bpmn2bepl: A bi-directional transformation between BPMN and BPEL
================================================================

This package contains libraries to implement a bi-directional
transformation between the business process modeling notation (BPMN)
and executable models of the business process execution language (BPEL).
The abstract syntax of process models is specified by a
contrext-free hypergraph grammar. The implementation
exploits the framework of functional logic GRAPh PArser combinators
(Grappa).

The ideas behind this implementation are described in this paper:
